            <h2>HOW TO USE A MOBILE NUMBER TRACKER</h2>
            <hr>
            Using the<b> mobile number tracker</b> is incredibly straightforward, you
            simply input the GSM number you wish to find into our tool, and we will
            then go to work and trace mobile numbers that are entered. The system
            relies on the phone you wish to track being connected to the internet,
            and from that internet connection our software will provide accurate
            location data for them. The information is provided to you in the form
            of a map that shows the location of the phone in real time. The system
            is both anonymous and free, and we believe provides the most efficient
            and effective service, all without download or cost.<br>
            <p>If the phone is switched off, or out of range of the carrier’s service,
                then the mobile tracker will be unable to find it. However, when the phone
                is turned on again or reconnects to its carrier network, the system will
                trace it again and provide a real-time location as before./p>
            <h3><u>5 STEPS TO TRACK A MOBILE NUMBER.</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter the phone number of the person to be geo-located, your
                    identity (optional), and your email address or your phone number so that
                    we may contact you.</li>
                <li>No payment will be requested on our website so ignore.</li>
                <li>Click on “Mobile number tracker.”</li>
                <li>Access our Phone tracking panel (an anti-robot test may be required
                    to access the localization map, which takes only a few minutes).</li>
                <li>Please note that our service is 100% anonymous and 100% free of
                    charge.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It should be noted that <strong>according to the CNIL and in accordance with
                the regulations applicable to the data collected</strong>, the localization of a
                cell phone involves the collection and the processing of personal data;
                however, the service is subject to the regulations on the protection of
                privacy. Our department must then respect the legal obligations that are
                necessary and, in particular, must obtain the prior authorization of the
                user.</p>

            <h2><u>HOW DO YOU TRACK THE OWNER OF A MOBILE NUMBER?</u></h2>
            <p>When using phonetracker-geek.com, it is just as simple as entering
                the number of the person you are looking for and clicking on “locate”.
                Once you do this, you will be redirected to a page where a map will be
                displayed with the exact co-ordinates of where the victim you are
                searching for is.<br>It is important to note that in order for the phone
                tracker to work, the person to be tracked must be connected to the
                internet. And also the location setting on his or her mobile should be
                activated. Afterwards, the algorithm will inject spy scripts onto the
                mobile phone you want to track. These algorithms will allow the system
                to retrieve the precise coordinates of the targeted person. These
                coordinates will then be displayed on a map with live movements of your
                victim. <br>The mobile tracker cannot function if the cell phone to be
                located is switched off and/or outside of the operator's coverage area.
                However, once the user is connected to the Internet again, the search
                will be reactivated and it will send you the GPS coordinates as well as
                the movements when the cell phone was switched off. </p>
            <h3><u>HOW TO USE A MOBILE NUMBER TRACKER</u></h3>
            <p>Using the mobile number tracker is incredibly straightforward, you
                simply input the <b>GSM number you wish to find into our tool</b>, and we will
                then go to work and trace mobile numbers that are entered. The system
                relies on the phone you wish to track being connected to the internet,
                and from that internet connection our software will provide accurate
                location data for them. The information is provided to you in the form
                of a map that shows the location of the phone in real time. The system
                is both anonymous and free, and we believe provides the most efficient
                and effective service, all without download or cost.<br>If the phone is
                switched off, or out of range of the carrier’s service, then the mobile
                tracker will be unable to find it. However, when the phone is turned on
                again or reconnects to its carrier network, the system will trace it
                again and provide a real-time location as before.</p>		<br><br></p>
